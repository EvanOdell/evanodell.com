It covers three main areas: the history of EHTs in England; the skills, qualities and motivations identified in EHTs by existing literature; and the governance and school structures associated with EHTs. The review also aims to place the English EHT in an international context by identifying similar executive leadership positions in decentralised and semi-decentralised education systems in other countries.},
