Built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), hosted on [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

The theme is a modified version of Dean Attali's [Beautiful Jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll), which is  under an MIT license, available [here](https://github.com/EvanOdell/evanodell.com/blob/master/LICENSE).

My modifications include, but are not limited to:
 * Adding automatic Creative Commons licensing to blog posts.
 * Changing the navbar and the footer to a darker colour.
 * Moving the location of the blog to a separate page, rather than the homepage.
 * Changing the default header font to Roboto and the default body font to Lusitana.
