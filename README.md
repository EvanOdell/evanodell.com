Fork for github pages blog, available at evanodell.github.io

The theme is a modified version of Dean Attali's [Beautiful Jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll), which is  under an MIT license, available [here](https://github.com/EvanOdell/evanodell.github.io/blob/master/theme/LICENSE).

My modifications include, but are not limited to:
 * Adding automatic Creative Commons licensing to blog posts.
 * Changing the navbar and the footer to a darker colour.
 * Moving the location of the blog to a separate page, rather than the homepage.
 * Changing the default header font to Roboto and the default body font to Lusitana.
