Hi, I'm Evan. I'm a data scientist and software developer, a social researcher and a lapsed tree planter. I'm originally from Canada, spent six years in the UK and now call Berlin home. If you want to work on something together, do [get in touch](mailto:evan@evanodell.com) or check out my [CV](/cv).

I create and maintain a dataset of [speeches made in the UK House of Commons](/hansard-data), which is more accurate in identifying speakers and is easier to use than both the official Hansard record and the mysociety ParlParse project. I have written a range of <a href="http://docs.evanodell.com/" target="_blank">R packages</a> to streamline scientific research.

I have a semi-frequently used [Twitter](https://twitter.com/evanodell) feed, and have a bunch of completed and ongoing projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/EvanOdell). I occasionally write stuff on my [blog](/blog) and in other places.

I'm a big fan of making maps. I've built a [map of where in London has the best value-for-money housing](/projects/housing-bang-buck/) for access to public transport, and mapped out [every golf course close to a train station in South-East England](https://www.citymetric.com/fabric/within-2km-station-south-east-england-has-golf-courses-room-500000-homes-3736).
