Hi, I'm Evan. I'm a social researcher and data analyst, originally from Canada and currently living in London, working for Disability Rights UK. I'm particularly interested in policy issues around health, disabilities, education, employment, housing and transport (all of which are related). I'm very fond of mapping things, figuring out new ways of looking at a problem and demonstrating research findings.

I create and maintain a dataset of [speeches made in the UK House of Commons](/projects/datasets/hansard-data), which includes sentiment analysis, fewer spelling mistakes and more accurate speaker identification than the official record. I also have a few <a href="http://docs.evanodell.com/" target="_blank">R packages</a>, mostly for data retrieval and producing reproducible research on UK politics.

I have a semi-frequently used [Twitter](https://twitter.com/evanodell) feed, and have a bunch of completed and ongoing projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/EvanOdell). I've started building [Shiny apps](/projects/#shiny-applications), and use Shiny to power my ongoing comparison of the [financial advantages (or disadvantages) of cycling to work instead of taking public transport](/projects/cycling-vs-oyster), and the [map of where in London has the best value-for-money housing](/projects/housing-bang-buck/) in terms of public transport services. I occasionally write stuff on my [blog](/blog) and have published a few [reports and papers](/cv/#publications).

Besides all this technical stuff, I enjoy running, worrying that my musical tastes make me look like a pretentious snob, trying to read more fiction and enjoying living in a flat in London, rather than in a tent in northern British Columbia, like I used to.
