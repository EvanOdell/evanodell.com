Hi, I'm Evan. I'm a social researcher and campaigner, originally from Canada and currently living in London, working for Disability Rights UK. I'm particularly interested in quantitative research and data analysis, and my main areas of interest are health, disabilities, education and social policies. My favourite programming language is R, but I also work with Python, SQL and enjoy finding new ways to solve problems. I'm very fond of mapping things, because maps are cool, although the amount of insight you can actually get from a map is often overstated.

I create and maintain a dataset of <a href="/projects/datasets/hansard-data">speeches made in the UK House of Commons</a>, which includes sentiment analysis, fewer spelling mistakes and more accurate speaker identification than the official record.

I have a semi-frequently used <a href="https://twitter.com/evanodell">Twitter</a> feed, and have a bunch of completed and ongoing projects on <a href="https://github.com/EvanOdell">GitHub</a>. I've started building <a href="/projects/#shiny-applications">Shiny apps</a>, and use Shiny to power my ongoing comparison of the <a href="/projects/cycling-vs-oyster">financial advantages (or disadvantages) of cycling to work instead of taking public transit</a>. I've also written a few <a href="http://docs.evanodell.com/hansard">R packages</a>. I occasionally write stuff on my <a href="/blog">blog</a> and have published a few <a href="/cv/#publications">reports and papers</a>.

Besides all this technical stuff, I enjoy running, worrying that my musical tastes make me look like a pretentious snob, trying to read more fiction and enjoying living in a flat in London, rather than in a tent in northern British Columbia, like I used to.
