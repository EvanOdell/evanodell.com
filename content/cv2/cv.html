<h2>Evan Odell</h2>
<p>Currently searching for a position at the intersections of public policy, health and data. I’ve built many <a href="https://docs.evanodell.com">R packages to streamline social science research</a> and maintain a widely used dataset of UK parliamentary speeches far superior to the official version. I make interactive maps of things like the <a href="https://evanodell.shinyapps.io/london-housing-bang-buck/">relationship between housing prices and public transport services</a>, or <a href="https://www.citymetric.com/fabric/within-2km-station-south-east-england-has-golf-courses-room-500000-homes-3736">the amount of land given over to golfing</a>.</p>
