  abstract = {Objective Investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the Lightning Process (LP) in addition to specialist medical care (SMC) compared with SMC alone, for children with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)/myalgic encephalitis (ME).Design Pragmatic randomised controlled open trial. Participants were randomly assigned to SMC or SMC+LP. Randomisation was minimised by age and gender.Setting Specialist paediatric CFS/ME service.Patients 12\textendash{}18\,year olds with mild/moderate CFS/ME.Main outcome measures The primary outcome was the the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey Physical Function Subscale (SF-36-PFS) at 6\,months. Secondary outcomes included pain, anxiety, depression, school attendance and cost-effectiveness from a health service perspective at 3, 6 and 12 months.Results We recruited 100 participants, of whom 51 were randomised to SMC+LP. Data from 81 participants were analysed at 6 months. Physical function (SF-36-PFS) was better in those allocated SMC+LP (adjusted difference in means 12.5(95\% CI 4.5 to 20.5), p=0.003) and this improved further at 12 months (15.1 (5.8 to 24.4), p=0.002). At 6 months, fatigue and anxiety were reduced, and at 12 months, fatigue, anxiety, depression and school attendance had improved in the SMC+LP\,arm. Results were similar following multiple imputation. SMC+LP was probably more cost-effective in the multiple imputation dataset (difference in means in net monetary benefit at 12 months \textsterling{}1474(95\% CI \textsterling{}111 to \textsterling{}2836), p=0.034) but not for complete cases.Conclusion The LP is effective and is probably cost-effective when provided in addition to SMC for mild/moderately affected adolescents with CFS/ME.Trial registration number ISRCTN81456207.},

This report provides an introduction to the project, explains what Corine data is and provides an overview of land cover in the United Kingdom. It also looks a little more closely at land cover in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.\\
It includes some local maps of land cover plus two Appendices. Appendix 1 provides further details on the Corine Land Cover 2012 classification used herein and Appendix 2 provides some further supplementary data tables. \\
Overall, the UK is nearly 29\% pasture land and just over 27\% non-irrigated arable land. In terms of land cover, the UK is less than 6\% urban. See this report and the associated maps for more detail.\\
