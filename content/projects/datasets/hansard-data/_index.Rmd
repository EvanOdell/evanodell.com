A public dataset of speeches in the Hansard, stored as a CSV, and as a [tibble](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tibble) class in RDS files, for the [R programming language](https://cran.r-project.org/).[^1] It includes the text and sentiment classifications for every speech made in the House of Commons between the 1979 general election and the end of 2017, with information on the speaking MP, their party, gender, birth date,[^2] starting and finishing dates (if applicable) as an MP, and age at the time of the speech. For pre-1979 election data, please see [here](https://evanodell.com/projects/datasets/hansard-data/archive/V250). Documentation for previous versions of the dataset including sentiment calculations can be found [here](https://evanodell.com/projects/datasets/hansard-data/archive/)

It can be accessed through [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/1183893), and is distributed under a Creative Commons 4.0 BY-SA license. The latest version expands coverage to the end of 2018, and includes information on cabinet and shadow cabinet positions.

## Methodology

The [parlparse](https://github.com/mysociety/parlparse) project provides scraped xml files of Hansard debate going back to 1936, and assigns an ID to each speaker. However, I could not find where the IDs assigned are linked to other information, such as constituencies or parties, or the MNIS ID system used by parliament. Long-serving MPs may also have dozens of these IDs assigned to them, and they are not consistently linked together. There are also substantial numbers of speeches where there is no ID assigned a speaker, and they are classified as 'unknown'. I created a table with every possible combination of name and `speaker_id`, `person_id` and `hansard_membership_id`, and matched the speakers in that table to their MNIS ID, using a mixture of exact string, manually checked approximate strings and manual matching/hand coding. The information in this table was then matched to the complete list of speech IDs. In the case of common names,[^3] I manually identified which MP was actually speaking by locating adjacent Hansard records where their full name, constituency or ministerial title was used. In a handful of cases I had to use the content of their speech and any adjacent speeches to provide further clues to an MPs identity.

[^2]: Sarah Olney (mnis_id 4591) does not have a birth date listed in the Members Names Information Service, and I have been unable to locate her date of birth elsewhere, only the year of birth. Her birthdate is, as a consequence, listed as 1977-01-01, this will be amended to the correct month and day if her biography is updated. Several members (Gillian Keegan, Laura Smith, Mike Hill) still do not have birth dates listed at all, and I could not locate exact dates for Anna McMorrin, Bob Seely, Danielle Rowley, Fiona Onasanya, Kemi Badenoch, so listed their birthday as the first of the given year or month. This will be updated in future versions of this data set.
