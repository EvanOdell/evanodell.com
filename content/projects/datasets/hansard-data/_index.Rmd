## [Download from Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.780985)

A dataset containing every speech in the House of Commons from May 1979-July 2020.

## Version 3.0.1

Version 3 is a major update of this dataset, with the following changes:

- Coverage up to the end of August 2020

- More information on government, opposition and parliamentary posts.

- Information on MPs constituencies.

- Inclusion of topical debate headings from the Hansard record

- Removal of easily accessible information like birthdays from the flat file.

- Fixes to various encoding issues. 


### File formats

The data is available as a [`tibble`](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/)-format .rds file for the R programming language, and as a CSV/JSON dataset. 

The CSV file does not contain the "government_posts", "opposition_posts" and "parliamentary_posts" variables, those are available in the JSON files of the same name. This is due to the data structure which is not compatible with the flat file CSVs. Some MPs have multiple posts at once, which are in list columns. Eg:

```
[
  {
    "mnis_id": "177",
    "date": "2008-10-06",
    "government_posts": [
      {
        "gov_post_name": "Minister of State (Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform) (Trade, Investment and Consumer Affairs) (also Department for International Development)"
      },
      {
        "gov_post_name": "Minister of State (Department for International Development)"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```
