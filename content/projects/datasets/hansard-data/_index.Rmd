## [Download from Zenodo](http:doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.780985)

A public dataset of speeches in the Hansard, stored as a [tibble](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tibble) class in RDS files, for the [R programming language](https://cran.r-project.org/).[^1] It includes the text and sentiment classifications for every speech made in the House of Commons between the 1979 general election and the end of 2017, with information on the speaking MP, their party, gender, birth date,[^2] starting and finishing dates (if applicable) as an MP, and age at the time of the speech. For pre-1979 election data, please see [here](https://evanodell.com/projects/datasets/hansard-data/archive/V250). Documentation for previous versions of the _Hansard Speeches and Sentiment_ dataset can be found [here](https://evanodell.com/projects/datasets/hansard-data/archive/)

The `hansard_senti_post_V250` dataset contains 2,196,175 speeches and 382,484,493 words. It is distributed under a Creative Commons 4.0 BY-SA licence. It can be accessed through [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/1183893), and is distributed under a Creative Commons 4.0 BY-SA license. The latest version expands coverage to the end of 2017, corrects several thousand spelling errors and includes two new sentiment classification methods.

For details on how speech sentiments were classified, [see below](/datasets/hansard-data/#sentiment-classification-methods).


## Sentiment Classification Methods

The speeches have been classified for sentiment using a total of six libraries from the R package [`lexicon`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=lexicon) by Tyler Rinker, and [one by Ludovic Rheault, Kaspar Beelen, Christopher Cochrane and Graeme Hirst](https://github.com/lrheault/emotion). All classification has used the method in Tyler Rinker's [`sentimentr`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sentimentr) package [@rinker2017]. The libraries are:

1. The [AFINN](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/views/publication_details.php?id=6010) library, labelled `afinn`. The AFINN library was accessed through Matthew Jockers's [`syuzhet`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=syuzhet) package [@nielsen2011].

2. A variant of the [syuzhet](https://cran.r-project.org/package=syuzhet) library, included in the [`lexicon`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=lexicon) package, labelled `jockers`. [@jockers2015].

3. The [NRC Word-Emotion Association Lexicon](http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/lexicons.html), labelled `nrc`. The NRC library was access through the [`lexicon`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=lexicon) package. [@mohammad2013].

4. The [Opinion Mining, Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Spam Detection](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html) library, labelled `huliu`. The library was access through the [`lexicon`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=lexicon) package. [@hu2004].

5. A modified version of the [unnamed lexicon](https://github.com/lrheault/emotion) from [this paper](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0168843), labelled `rheault`. As the method in `sentimentr` does not use distinguish between the same word that can occupy multiple lexical categories,[^3] I used the average polarity score assigned to such words.[^4] [@rheault2016].

6. A combination of the [syuzhet](https://cran.r-project.org/package=syuzhet) and [Opinion Mining, Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Spam Detection](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html) libraries created by Rinker, labelled `jockers_rinker`.

7. The [Augmented SenticNet 4 Polarity Table](http://sentic.net/downloads/) from [`lexicon`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=lexicon), labelled `senticnet` [@cambria2016].


## Summary Statistics

## Dataset Variables

The `hansard_senti_post_V250` and `hansard_senti_pre_V250` datasets have slightly different variables, as there is more information available for all post-1979 MPs, and that is included in `hansard_senti_post_V250`.

## Notes on the dataset

The historical Hansard record often uses inconsistent and confusing naming conventions for MPs. I have not matched pre-1979 election MPs to their MNIS IDs, as not all pre-1979 election MPs will have an MNIS ID to be matched to, and the naming conventions appear to be particularly confusing. Long term I hope to develop a convention for a unique ID code for MPs that can identify them, their party, their constituency and any office they held at the time, but that is a project without a timetable.

## Methodology

The [parlparse](https://github.com/mysociety/parlparse) project provides scraped xml files of Hansard debate going back to 1936, and assigns an ID to each speaker. However, I could not find where the IDs assigned are linked to other information, such as constituencies or parties, or the MNIS ID system used by parliament. Long-serving MPs may also have dozens of these IDs assigned to them, and they are not consistently linked together. There are also substantial numbers of speeches where there is no ID assigned a speaker, and they are classified as 'unknown'. I created a table with every possible combination of name and `speaker_id`, `person_id` and `hansard_membership_id`, and matched the speakers in that table to their MNIS ID, using a mixture of exact string, manually checked approximate strings and manual matching/hand coding. The information in this table was then matched to the complete list of speech IDs. In the case of common names,[^6] I manually identified which MP was actually speaking by locating adjacent Hansard records where their full name, constituency or ministerial title was used. In a handful of cases I had to use the content of their speech and any adjacent speeches to provide further clues to an MPs identity.

Several members (Gillian Keegan, Laura Smith, Mike Hill) still do not have birth dates listed at all, and I could not locate exact dates for Anna McMorrin, Bob Seely, Danielle Rowley, Fiona Onasanya, Kemi Badenoch, so listed their birthday as the first of the given year or month.
