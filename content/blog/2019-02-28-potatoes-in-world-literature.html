<p>Potatoes are an undeniably important vegetable, far more important to human history than say, brocolli. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/History-Influence-Cambridge-Paperback-Library/dp/0521316235"><em>The History and Social Influence of the Potato</em></a> is 768 pages long, and “<a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/v08/n09/angela-carter/potatoes-and-point">an extraordinary book, like no other, a vast compendium of curious fact and passionately recounted social history that calls to mind an unexpected but completely satisfying fusion of <em>The Anatomy of Melancholy</em> and Fernand Braudel’s <em>Capitalism and Material Life</em></a>”, according to Angela Carter. And Redcliffe Salaman’s academic history is complemented by several other books by popular historians.</p>
<p>Given their importance, I was curious how often potatoes are mentioned in fictional writing. Food may be considered less important than themes such as love, memory or morality to the literary critic, but food is an important part of human culture, even humble foods like the potato. Potatoes and their consumption have featured in visual art, such as the below painting by Vincent Van Gogh.</p>
{{% figure src="/img/potato/Van-willem-vincent-gogh-die-kartoffelesser-03850.jpg" caption="The Potato Eaters by Van Gogh, 1885, via Wikipedia" %}}
<p>I used the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=gutenbergr"><code>gutenbergr</code></a> R package, modifying some of the code in order to access the volume of books I needed, and updated the metadata using the python script available in its <a href="https://githuh.com/ropensci/gutenbergr">GitHub repository</a>. I downloaded everything in English, then selected all of the books that a) are listed as fiction in the Library of Congress Subject Headings, and b) include “potato” or some variation thereof. I focused on fiction to avoid the results being skewed by cookbooks and agricultural productivity reports and to identify the extent to which the potato has crept into the literary conciousness.</p>
<p>Most books that mention potatoes did so only once or twice, as shown in Figure <a href="#fig:potatochart">1</a>.</p>

<p>The mentions of potatoes roughly reflect the total numbers of books in a given genre (Table <a href="#tab:all-subjects-table">2</a>), although some genres are more common than others. Genres marked with an asterix are also in the top ten of mentions of potatoes. As seen in Table <a href="#tab:all-subjects-table">2</a>, although science fiction is a common genre, less than 10% of science fiction books mention potatoes. Clearly writing about the near or distant future pushes concern for tubers out of the author’s mind.</p>

<p>Table <a href="#tab:100-plus-potatoes">3</a> shows the 10 genres with the most mentions of potatoes, provided there are 100 or more books in each genre. Reflective of the lasting impact of the Irish Potato Famine on literature and cultural memory, books about Ireland appear the most likely to mention potatoes. Farm life and country life are the next most common, again unsurprisingly.</p>
<p>There are 19,675 mentions of potatoes across 5,897 books, an average of 3.3 per book mentioning potatoes. Across all English language fiction books, potatoes are mentioned an average of 1.13 times per book.</p>
<p>The book with the most mentions of potatoes, with 86 in total, is <em>The Mary Frances Cook Book; Or, Adventures Among the Kitchen People</em> by Jane Eayre Fryer, the full text of which is available <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38215">here</a>. While I excluded cookbooks, this is a story with recipes from 1912, hence the many mentions of potatoes, and the author’s description of her “book for all girls who love to help Mother.”</p>
<p>There are far too many instances of potatoes mentioned in literature to show them all, but I have a sample of 1% of all mentions of potatoes, examples from 59 of the total 5,897 books with at least one mention of potatoes in Table <a href="#tab:data-table">4</a>. You can download all the mentions of potatoes in context, along with subject data and Gutenberg catalogue number, in <a href="/files/potato-kwic.csv">this spreadsheet</a>.</p>
