In a [blog post](/blog/2017/02/06/cycling-vs-oyster/) in February I analysed how much money I was saving by cycling to work instead of using a monthly Oyster transit pass. When I wrote that blog I had spent almost Â£20 more on my bike and pay-as-you-go transit pass than I would have if I bought a monthly transit pass. Now, less than 3 months later and despite needing a new rear wheel, I've broken even, and I've been updating my data every week or so, and have now built another [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) app to monitor my spending on my bike and on transit.

You can see in the second time series plot that since writing the blog post in February my Oyster spending has dropped off somewhat. Since analysing how much I was cycling, and how much I was spending on transit, I've become much more dedicated to riding places, no longer taking the bus or the tube if I'm feeling a little bit lazy.
