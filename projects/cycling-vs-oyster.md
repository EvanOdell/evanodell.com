\*Updated every few days.

In a [blog post](/blog/2017/02/06/cycling-vs-oyster/) in February I analysed how much money I was saving by cycling to work instead of using a monthly Oyster transit pass. When I wrote that blog I had spent almost £20 more on my bike and pay-as-you-go transit pass than I would have if I bought a monthly transit pass. As of 29 April 2017, less than 3 months later and despite needing a new rear wheel, I broke even, and I've been updating my data every week or so, and have now built another [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) app to monitor my spending on my bike and on transit.

I include all spending directly on my bike, including the cost of the bike, accessories, spare parts, tools and maintenance. I also include non-bike costs that are the result of cycling, primarily clothing. For instance, I have bought a couple pairs of commuter trousers for cycling and include that spending in my calculations, less £40 to represent the price of a standard pair men's trousers, on the basis that I would have had to buy new trousers anyways.

You can see in the second time series plot that since writing the blog post in February my Oyster spending has dropped off somewhat. Since analysing how much I was cycling, and how much I was spending on transit, I've become much more dedicated to riding places, no longer taking the bus or the tube if I'm feeling a little bit lazy.

There are a number of obstacles to an exact cost comparison of cycling and public transit. For example, if I go on holiday for a couple weeks, I might time my oyster card renewal so I'm not paying anything while not in London. Moreover, there are the intangible benefits of exercise and shorter commutes from cycling, compared to the convenience and low required effort of public transit, and any purely financial comparison would have to take that into account.
