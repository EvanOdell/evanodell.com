An interactive map of the relative value-for-money of housing in London, based on the estimated cost-per-room in each property sold in the past five years and the level of public transport accessibility. Allows for subdividing by housing type, travel zone, transport accessibility level, local authority, and more! Builds on this <a href="/blog/2017/10/20/housing-prices-and-transport-accessibility/">blog post</a>, and prompted by a request from my former colleague <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/markbutcher91">Mark Butcher</a>.

A model for exploring what impact different electoral turnout scenarios would have on the seat distribution in the 2015 General Election in England. Initially inspired by the possibility raised by Jeremy Corbyn's election as Labour Party leader that Labour would attempt to win the next election by focusing on increasing voter turnout. The first proper Shiny app I made. To see this app, open R and run `shiny::runUrl("https://github.com/evanodell/England-TurnOut/archive/master.zip")`
